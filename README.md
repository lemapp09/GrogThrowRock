# GrogThrowRock
VR Adventure for MetaVerse VR Hackathon

Note: DemoScene is our project scene, located at Assets/ Samples/ XR Interaction Toolkit/ 2.2.0/ Starter Assets/DemoScene.unity 

    Grog loves butterflies and bunnies, but he hates those big noisy birds. So Grog throws rocks at the planes.    
    
    Its challenging to throw in VR, so we've added an assist. The rocks have a homing sense for the planes.
    
    At the end of each level, the rocks return to their starting position on top of the rock platform.
